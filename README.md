# Penn-Cloud

## Overview of the project

Penn cloud is a cloud platform that supports web-mail service and storage service analogous to Gmail and Google Drive. Storage was based on distributed key-value store (similar to Bigtable) and factors like load balancing, fault tolerance, replication, consistency were taken into consideration as well.
